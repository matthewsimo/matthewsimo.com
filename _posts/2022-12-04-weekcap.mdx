A weekly recap, _a weekcap_, for the 48th week of the year 2022.

It's December! I really like this time of year, though I wish Houston was colder. I took advantage of one of the days in the 50s (LOL!) we got and made Chicken Udon - so good! Ben didn't care for it too much though... Will have to work on that!

At work, I started contributing to a new client project this week. It's a React Native project which I haven't touched or looked at in like 5? years?! Should be fun and a nice change in pace. Though [I discovered](https://twitter.com/matthewsimo/status/1598036479279828997?s=20&t=R-wnGvGJLpH2ykOaeeXzww) this in my first couple days contributing: [React Native's Flex implementation doesn't support gap](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/3628) - what year is it?!

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) started, and I'm using it as an excuse to finally buckle down and learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) &mdash; you can follow my progress [here](https://github.com/matthewsimo/aoc-2022).

> Approaching a new language can be scary and time consuming. The author has been a C++ programmer for quite some time and has tried to give Rust a chance many times over the years with not much success. But this has changed.

I watched and read more tutorials than fingers on my hands and came across this wonderful talk. Applies to much more than Rust. There's a lot of points in common with [Range - Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World](https://davidepstein.com/the-range/), which coincidentally, I read last month and why it resonated with me.

Always wondered how metaballs worked, so I went down a rabbit hole that had this at the bottom.

First time I've come across this artist, they got some really lovely tones out of the guitar and vocals on this album.
