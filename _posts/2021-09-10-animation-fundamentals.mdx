Animation can seem daunting. But it is built on a pretty simple idea, interpolation. That concept is exactly what I aim to dive into here. I will do my best to minimize the maths, promise. If you stick with me, by the end of this article, you will become a master of space and time!

Fundamentally, you can not have an animation without _**time**_. If you want to animate something, it is just an implicit part of the deal. _**We want to do something**_ over the span of _**some duration time**_. What we do is arbitrary. We could move the position of a thing. Change a thing's opacity value. Modifiy its scale. Doesn't matter, eniterly up to what visual effect we're tring to achieve.

Let's imagine we have a box.

```
<box />
```

It will sound really obvious. But, if we want to move that box from the left to the right, it _**must**_ pass through

```
