I had run into [this problem](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/1130) where my Theme UI theme's base styles weren't being applied to the MDX file markup. I thought it was something specific to my site's configuration so I foolishly spent too much time messing around to validate that and even did the work to upgrade from [next-mdx](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/packages/next-mdx) to [next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced).

I won't make any metaphors about the JS ecosystem and its packages being a house of cards or anything but it turns out that if you have multiple dependencies relying on differring versions of a shared sub depepency you might run into a _problem_. Now, I was interested in this so I did some digging. Not a ton, but there wasn't a whole lot of info into what or why that can really be a problem, aside from the obvious that npm packages totally don't have to adhere to semver. So good luck I guess.

In case you aren't lucky, like me, this tip might help get you moving.

Firstly, use yarn, it adds a much needed measure of deterministic behavior to your installs. [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Then, you'll want to see if you have any packages dupes. If you have an inkling of the most likely offenders be sure to add the `--pattern [term]` flag, it'll limit the number of matches by the term for much easier parsing.

```bash
$ yarn list --pattern [term]
```

Then the neat bit, yarn supports a `resolutions` key in your `package.json` file. It allows a project to selectively control depepency resolution - so if there's a mismatch for a shared depepency you can force a package that you don't control to use a specific version.

```json
"resolutions": {
    "[package||path||:link||:portal]": "[version override]"
  }
```

The targeting is pretty flexible too, so be sure to check out the [docs](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions).
