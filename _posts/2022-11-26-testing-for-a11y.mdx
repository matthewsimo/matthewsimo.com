At work, I'm giving (or gave, depending on when you view this) a Rightpoint FED Roundtable talk on how & why to set up a11y testing.

Tooling to make solid a11y compliance has come a long way. It's super straightforward and can make a huge difference for catching baseline accesibility bugs. I don't think there are any good reasons not to implement these tools into your workflows. Give it a look, and let me know any thoughts or feedback.
