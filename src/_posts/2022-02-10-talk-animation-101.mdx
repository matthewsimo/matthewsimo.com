At work, I'm the current Discipline Lead for Frontend Development. Part of my responsibilties in that role is to organize a weekly learn session that helps expose the team at large to new technology as well as help align and communicate best practices.

Something I implemented during my time is the notion of "series". Once per quarter, we'd drill into one topic over the course of multiple sessions.

We just begain an Animation series as it can help take a site to the next level. To help tee off the session, I gave a sort of historical overview and introduction.
